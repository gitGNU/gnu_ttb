TabletToolbox README -- Important introductory notes.

TabletToolbox (ttb) is a toolbox application for tablet PCs.
TabletToolbox is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 included in the
file COPYING.

Requirements
------------

You need:
	glib
	gobject-2.0
	gtk+-2.0

Using TabletToolbox
-------------------

TabletToolbox reads .desktop files located in ~/.local/share/applications/ttb
and presents the user with a list of applications to launch. For now, the only
way to add applications to TabletToolbox is to manually copy those files
there.

You can use your desktop environments settings to setup a hot-key to run
TabletToolbox when you e.g. press a `Toolbox' button on a cover of your tablet
PC. Alternatively, I recommend xbindkeys for that job (see
http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys for more details).

Technical note
--------------

Please note that parsing .desktop entries' `Exec' key isn't exactly
freedesktop.org compliant. It works well with all the .desktop files I tested,
but if you run into problems, please let me know.

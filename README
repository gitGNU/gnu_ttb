TabletToolbox README -- Important introductory notes.

TabletToolbox (ttb) is a toolbox application for tablet PCs.
TabletToolbox is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 included in the
file COPYING.

Requirements
------------

You need:
	glib
	gobject-2.0
	gtk+-2.0

Using TabletToolbox
-------------------

TabletToolbox allows the user to configure a list of applications, which then
can be easily launched through simple button press.

You can use your desktop environments settings to setup a hot-key to run
TabletToolbox when you e.g. press a `Toolbox' button on a cover of your tablet
PC. Alternatively, I recommend xbindkeys for that job (see
http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys for more details).

Technical note
--------------

Please note that parsing .desktop entries' `Exec' key isn't exactly
freedesktop.org compliant. It works well with all the .desktop files I tested,
but if you run into problems, please let me know.
